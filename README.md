TREES with dynamic root growth

This repository contains files associated with our study on conifer root growth and access to bedrock groundwater in a pinon-juniper refugia near Los Alamos, NM, USA. The repository contains code for the biophysical process-based model, Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES).

D. Scott Mackay, Philip R. Savoy, Charlotte Grossiord, Xiaonan Tai, Jonathan R. Pleban, Diane R. Wang, Nathan G. McDowell, Henry D. Adams, and John S. Sperry. Conifers depend on established roots during drought: results from a coupled model of carbon allocation and hydraulics. New Phytologist, in review.

Two folder are found in this repository:

  model-code contains the complete C++ code for TREES, version 3, with dynamic root growth
  
  model-inputs contains input files that go with this study
